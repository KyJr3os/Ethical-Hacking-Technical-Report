# Ethical Hacking Technical Report
Client: Acme Technologies
Date: 11/05/2024
Prepared by: Cyrus David B. Sandrino and Mike L. Rempillo Jr.

## Executive Summary:
This report presents the technical findings of the ethical hacking assessment conducted for Acme Technologies. The assessment aimed to identify vulnerabilities within the organization's network infrastructure, applications, and systems. Through various testing methodologies, including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, critical and high-risk issues were discovered. This report provides detailed descriptions of these findings, along with actionable recommendations for remediation.

## Vulnerability Summary:
1. Network Infrastructure:
   - **Critical:** Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution vulnerability (CVE-2024-1234) in the Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) running on [Server Name], allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely.
   - **High:** Misconfigured firewall rules permitting unrestricted access from external IP ranges to sensitive internal services (e.g., SSH, RDP) on [Server IP/Hostname].

2. Web Applications:
   - **Critical:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the login form of Acme Portal, potentially enabling an attacker to execute malicious scripts in users' browsers.
   - **High:** SQL Injection vulnerability in the user profile page of Acme Shop, allowing attackers to extract sensitive data from the database.

3. Operating Systems:
   - **Critical:** Outdated and unpatched operating systems (Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS) on critical servers [Server Names], exposing them to known exploits and malware.
   - **High:** Weak password policies on domain user accounts, facilitating brute-force attacks and unauthorized access.

4. Wireless Networks:
   - **Critical:** Lack of encryption used in wireless networks, allowing attackers to intercept and decrypt wireless traffic, exposing sensitive data.
   - **High:** Insecure Wi-Fi network configuration, allowing unauthorized access and potential Man-in-the-Middle attacks.

5. Social Engineering:
   - **High:** Several employees fell victim to phishing emails, providing credentials and sensitive information in response.
   - **High:** Lack of employee awareness regarding social engineering tactics, leading to the inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information.

## Recommendations:
1. Network Infrastructure:
   - Immediately patch Nginx to the latest version to mitigate the Remote Code Execution vulnerability.
   - Review and update firewall rules to restrict access based on the principle of least privilege.

2. Web Applications:
   - Conduct a thorough code review and implement input validation to prevent XSS and SQL Injection attacks.
   - Implement security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy) to mitigate XSS vulnerabilities.

3. Operating Systems:
   - Develop a patch management process to regularly update and secure operating systems against known vulnerabilities.
   - Enforce strong password policies and consider implementing multi-factor authentication for domain user accounts.

4. Wireless Networks:
   - Upgrade wireless network encryption to WPA2 or WPA3 to ensure confidentiality and integrity of wireless communications.
   - Perform regular wireless security assessments to identify and mitigate configuration weaknesses.

5. Social Engineering:
   - Conduct regular security awareness training for employees to educate them about the risks of phishing attacks and how to identify and report suspicious emails.
   - Implement simulated phishing campaigns to reinforce training and measure employee awareness.

## Conclusion:
The findings of the ethical hacking assessment highlight several critical vulnerabilities and security weaknesses within Acme Technologies' infrastructure and applications. By implementing the recommended remediation measures, Acme Technologies can significantly enhance its security posture and mitigate the risk of cyber threats and data breaches.
