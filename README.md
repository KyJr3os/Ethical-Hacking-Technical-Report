# Ethical Hacking Technical Report
**Client:** **ACME TECHNOLOGIES**

**Date:** 11/05/2024

**Prepared by:** Cyrus David B. Sandrino and Mike L. Rempillo Jr.

## Executive Summary:
>This comprehensive report details the outcomes of an ethical hacking assessment undertaken for Acme Technologies. The primary objective of this assessment was to meticulously scrutinize the organization's network infrastructure, applications, and systems for potential vulnerabilities. Employing a combination of robust testing methodologies including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, the assessment unearthed a spectrum of critical and high-risk vulnerabilities. These findings are meticulously outlined in this report, accompanied by strategic recommendations tailored for effective remediation.

## Vulnerability Summary:
1. Network Infrastructure:
   - **Critical:** Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution vulnerability (CVE-2024-1234) in the Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) running on [Server Name], allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely.
   - **High:** Misconfigured firewall rules permitting unrestricted access from external IP ranges to sensitive internal services (e.g., SSH, RDP) on [Server IP/Hostname].
   - **High:** Insecure SNMP configuration on network devices, allowing unauthorized access and information disclosure.
   - 

2. Web Applications:
   - **Critical:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the login form of Acme Portal, potentially enabling an attacker to execute malicious scripts in users' browsers.
   - **High:** SQL Injection vulnerability in the user profile page of Acme Shop, allowing attackers to extract sensitive data from the database.
   - **High:** Insufficient session management in Acme Dashboard, leading to session fixation attacks.

3. Operating Systems:
   - **Critical:** Outdated and unpatched operating systems (Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS) on critical servers [Server Names], exposing them to known exploits and malware.
   - **High:** Weak password policies on domain user accounts, facilitating brute-force attacks and unauthorized access.
   - **Medium:** Lack of file system integrity monitoring on critical servers, increasing the risk of unauthorized changes.

4. Wireless Networks:
   - **Critical:** Lack of encryption used in wireless networks, allowing attackers to intercept and decrypt wireless traffic, exposing sensitive data.
   - **Medium:** Rogue access points detected within the corporate network, posing a risk of unauthorized access and data exfiltration.

5. Social Engineering:
   - **High:** Several employees fell victim to phishing emails, providing credentials and sensitive information in response.
   - **Medium:** Employees readily disclosed sensitive information during phone-based pretexting attacks.

## Recommendations:
1. Network Infrastructure:
   - Immediately patch Nginx to the latest version to mitigate the Remote Code Execution vulnerability.
   - Review and update firewall rules to restrict access based on the principle of least privilege.
   - Configure SNMP securely, using strong community strings and limiting access to authorized devices.

2. Web Applications:
   - Conduct a thorough code review and implement input validation to prevent XSS and SQL Injection attacks.
   - Implement security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy) to mitigate XSS vulnerabilities.
   - Improve session management practices, including random session IDs and session expiration.

3. Operating Systems:
   - Develop a patch management process to regularly update and secure operating systems against known vulnerabilities.
   - Enforce strong password policies and consider implementing multi-factor authentication for domain user accounts.
   - Implement file system integrity monitoring solutions to detect unauthorized changes.

4. Wireless Networks:
   - Upgrade wireless network encryption to WPA2 or WPA3 to ensure confidentiality and integrity of wireless communications.
   - Implement wireless intrusion detection systems (WIDS) to detect and mitigate rogue access points.

5. Social Engineering:
   - Conduct regular security awareness training for employees to educate them about the risks of phishing attacks and how to identify and report suspicious emails.
   - Implement procedures for verifying the identity of individuals requesting sensitive information over the phone.

## Conclusion:
>The findings of the ethical hacking assessment underscore the pressing need for proactive security measures within Acme Technologies' infrastructure and applications. The identification of critical vulnerabilities and security weaknesses serves as a clarion call for immediate action. By swiftly implementing the prescribed remediation strategies delineated in this report, Acme Technologies can fortify its security posture significantly. This proactive stance not only mitigates the imminent threat of cyberattacks but also bolsters the organization's resilience against potential data breaches.
